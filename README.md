# React Personal Site

## What it's built with
- React framework
- ReactRouter for route management
  - Using V7, but only implementing as library
- tailwindcss for quick styling
- Vite to build it quickly lol

## Purpose
Built with the primary goal of simply having a personal site to finally host at my domain; however, turned into something a little more. This is because I decided to try to use React as "properly" as I could while also having the goal to learn the ReactRouter library for navigation.

### Additional Note
I recognize that I have like 4 repos by now of personal site implementations, they just happen to each be containing implementations that I for whatever reason deemed unfinished and unfit to host. Each one also tends to represent something new that I was trying to focus on learning at the time that I made it. Yes, I do already have a personal site repo that used react, but with this one I specifically wanted to use tailwindcss for the styles rather than raw css along with actually properly taking advantage of react rather than just making a glorified HTML page.
